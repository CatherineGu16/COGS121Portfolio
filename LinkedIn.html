                    customer satisfaction by improving its job search and application process.
                    <br>
                    We engaged in two major processes to ensure we created a user-centric design
                    that would truly help LinkedIn succeed, starting with exploratory methods before the redesign,
                    and then various user testing to inform and test the redesign.

                    potential issues and ranked them based on severity to prioritize
                    which issues needed to be addressed first.

                        To investigate potential ideas and features for
                        our site, we did competitive analysis of 5 other small Japanese restaurant sites and 2
                        chain restaurant websites to see how they demonstrated their color
                        scheme, mood, site navigation, and other special features. Some of the
                        key takeaways we drew from our analysis were to have very clean color
                        palettes and styles throughout the site, splitting our long menu into
                        different sections to allow for easier browsing, creating multiple pages
                        for different sections of the site instead of having a singular landing page,
                        and reducing the amount of text users will need to read. From these insights,
                        we began thinking about site navigation and created moodboards that would encapsulate the feel
                        of our
                        website.

                        With a clear vision of what we wanted to create for the website, we
                        began with a wireframe that mostly outlined our site architecture,
                        image placement, and home screen reorganization for both the mobile
                        and desktop version. As a group, we also discussed potential issues and
                        created fallback plans in case some of our features were not implementable.
                        <br>
                        After settling on our wireframe outline, we began adding in images,
                        buttons, and actual text. My main role was working on the menu and its
                        related pages, including the main menu page, the menu item customization page,
                        and the payment page. In this first iteration, our menu had no images of
                        specific dishes because the restaurant did not have the resources to be
                        able to include an image with every single menu item. This was also
                        where I included the idea of using tabular organization with icons to
                        allow users to isolate and only see one food category at a time.

                <h1 class="linkedin-headings">Critiques + Higher Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                <div class="linkedin-body">
                    Upon completing our low fidelity prototype, we sought out critiques from
                    our client, our peers, and our professor. Through this process, we
                    received helpful feedback that allowed us to improve on our site.
                    One major flaw we found was that we lacked any confirmation page,
                    which made it unclear for the user whether their order had gone through
                    or if their reservation was made. The site overall was still relatively
                    plain so we added a cherry blossom background to begin synching the color scheme.
                    I also experimented with a second version of the menu that split
                    customization into a different page and enlarged the visual for the menu item.
                    This would allow the menu page to appear less cluttered and allow the
                    users to see the dish they are ordering which could help inform their decision.

                    We received no complaints about the functionality and flow of our website,
                    however they did have some qualms about our choice of background. They
                    observed that the background was a little too distracting and clashed
                    with the actual content of our website. The menu page was also a little
                    too simple with the removal of all information except the name, image,
                    and price of the dish. After receiving the feedback from this test, we created our final prototype.

                <h1 class="linkedin-headings">What did I learn?</h1>
                <div class="linkedin-body">As this was my first time working with a client,
                    one challenge our group faced was managing client expectations and aligning
                    that with the customers’ needs and the widely-used practices in design.
                    The feature that was most difficult to resolve was the inclusion of
                    reviews on the website. Our client was adamant about not having reviews
                    on the website or buying good reviews on Yelp because he felt it was
                    biased and dishonest, whereas many of the users thought that the reviews
                    were useful in helping them decide whether they wanted to eat there or
                    what to order. We ended up deciding to follow the client’s request because,
                    ultimately, the site was for him and the users could find other ways to
                    find reviews themselves with external sites.
                    <br>
                    Overall, this experience taught me the importance of iteration and how
                    our designs can sometimes drastically change over the lifespan of our project.
                    My role in the creation of the prototype was creating the menu pages.
                    My main struggle was determining the right balance of information that
                    would be present within one screen. I experimented with both having too
                    much and too little information and through getting many iterations of
                    feedback, I was able to identify the perfect mix of both.
                    <br>
                    Ultimately, we were able to implement all of the features we planned for and created a site that I

      <div class="kinoyume-column">
        <h2 class="kinoyume-subheadings">Overview</h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Project Context</h1>

        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">Kinoyume is a Japanese restaurant located in 
          La Jolla that specializes in Japanese comfort food including sushi, 
          rice bowls, ramen, artisan Japanese sets, as well as drinks. </h2>
          <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          Our team visited Kinoyume and found that although the interior of their 
          restaurant was incredibly homey and well decorated, their unpolished website 
          failed to effectively reflect the style of the restaurant. In addition, users 
          who were visiting the site found that they had a difficult time ordering food items from the menu.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          Therefore, we decided to redesign and improve the aesthetic and 
          flow of Kinoyume’s website to increase user enjoyment when visiting the 
          site and allowing them to accomplish their goals more efficiently.

        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Identifying Client Needs: What does the client want out of their website?</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          After reviewing the website on our own, we did our own analysis and 
          identified potential features that would need to be fixed, but we wanted 
          to gather direct feedback from the manager of Kinoyume. During our first 
          interview with our client, we found that the client was also unhappy with the 
          current restaurant website and he identified a few specific features he wanted: 
          a more presentable menu ordering system, consistent color schemes that better 
          match the restaurant, and fixing broken links.
        </h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Identifying User Needs: What do visitors of the website want to see?</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          After finding out what the manager wanted out of the website, we went 
          to the customers and conducted group interviews with the groups of 
          Kinoyume customers to see which aspects of the website were pain points 
          from a user perspective. Some major points the user hoped to see included: 
          having a better looking site, making it easier to use, and being able 
          to check restaurant reviews.
          Upon interviewing the customers, we grouped the interviewees into 3 
          user personas based on shared value: convenience, budget, or service.
        </h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Putting it all together</h1>
          <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          With all the information we received through interviewing our two major 
          stakeholders, we now had to determine which aspects we would include 
          in our prototype and define what was within the scope of our project 
          and manageable within the time frame we had.

        <h2 class="kinoyume-subheadings">Ideation</h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">What do other websites do well?</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">To investigate potential ideas and features for 
          our site, we did competitive analysis of 5 other small Japanese restaurant sites and 2 
          chain restaurant websites to see how they demonstrated their color 
          scheme, mood, site navigation, and other special features. Some of the 
          key takeaways we drew from our analysis were to have very clean color 
          palettes and styles throughout the site, splitting our long menu into 
          different sections to allow for easier browsing, creating multiple pages 
          for different sections of the site instead of having a singular landing page, 
          and reducing the amount of text users will need to read.

    <!-- Process-->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="kinoyume-column">
        <h2 class="kinoyume-subheadings">Design and Prototyping</h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Wireframing + Low Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          With a clear vision of what we wanted to create for the website, we 
          began with a wireframe that mostly outlined our site architecture, 
          image placement, and home screen reorganization for both the mobile 
          and desktop version. As a group, we also discussed potential issues and 
          created fallback plans in case some of our features were not implementable.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          After settling on our wireframe outline, we began adding in images, 
          buttons, and actual text. My main role was working on the menu and its 
          related pages, including the main menu page, the menu item customization page, 
          and the payment page. In this first iteration, our menu had no images of 
          specific dishes because the restaurant did not have the resources to be 
          able to include an image with every single menu item. This was also 
          where I included the idea of using tabular organization with icons to 
          allow users to isolate and only see one food category at a time.
        </h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Critiques + Higher Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          Upon completing our low fidelity prototype, we sought out critiques from
           our client, our peers, and our professor. Through this process, we 
           received helpful feedback that allowed us to improve on our site. 
           One major flaw we found was that we lacked any confirmation page, 
           which made it unclear for the user whether their order had gone through 
           or if their reservation was made. The site overall was still relatively 
           plain so we added a cherry blossom background to begin synching the color scheme. 
           I also experimented with a second version of the menu that split 
           customization into a different page and enlarged the visual for the menu item. 
           This would allow the menu page to appear less cluttered and allow the 
           users to see the dish they are ordering which could help inform their decision.

        <h2 class="kinoyume-subheadings">Final Design</h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">User Testing + Final Prototype</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">Upon completion of our previous iteration, we 
          conducted one user test and provided them with scenarios to walk through our site. 
          We received no complaints about the functionality and flow of our website, 
          however they did have some qualms about our choice of background. They 
          observed that the background was a little too distracting and clashed 
          with the actual content of our website. The menu page was also a little 
          too simple with the removal of all information except the name, image, 
          and price of the dish. After receiving the feedback from this test, we created our final prototype.

        <h2 class="kinoyume-subheadings">Reflection</h2>
        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">What did I learn?</h1>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">As this was my first time working with a client, 
          one challenge our group faced was managing client expectations and aligning 
          that with the customers’ needs and the widely-used practices in design. 
          The feature that was most difficult to resolve was the inclusion of 
          reviews on the website. Our client was adamant about not having reviews 
          on the website or buying good reviews on Yelp because he felt it was 
          biased and dishonest, whereas many of the users thought that the reviews 
          were useful in helping them decide whether they wanted to eat there or 
          what to order. We ended up deciding to follow the client’s request because, 
          ultimately, the site was for him and the users could find other ways to 
          find reviews themselves with external sites.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          Overall, this experience taught me the importance of iteration and how 
          our designs can sometimes drastically change over the lifespan of our project. 
          My role in the creation of the prototype was creating the menu pages. 
          My main struggle was determining the right balance of information that 
          would be present within one screen. I experimented with both having too 
          much and too little information and through getting many iterations of 
          feedback, I was able to identify the perfect mix of both.
        </h2>
        <h2 class="kinoyume-body">
          Ultimately, we were able to implement all of the features we planned for and created a site that I believe everyone was happy with.

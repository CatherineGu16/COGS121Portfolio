        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Project Context</h1>

        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">Kinoyume is a Japanese restaurant located in
          La Jolla that specializes in Japanese comfort food including sushi,
          rice bowls, ramen, artisan Japanese sets, as well as drinks. </h3>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          Our team visited Kinoyume and found that although the interior of their
          restaurant was incredibly homey and well decorated, their unpolished website
          failed to effectively reflect the style of the restaurant. In addition, users
          who were visiting the site found that they had a difficult time ordering food items from the menu.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          Therefore, we decided to redesign and improve the aesthetic and
          flow of Kinoyumeâ€™s website to increase user enjoyment when visiting the
          site and allowing them to accomplish their goals more efficiently.

        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          After reviewing the website on our own, we did our own analysis and
          identified potential features that would need to be fixed, but we wanted
          to gather direct feedback from the manager of Kinoyume. During our first
          interview with our client, we found that the client was also unhappy with the
          current restaurant website and he identified a few specific features he wanted:
          a more presentable menu ordering system, consistent color schemes that better
          match the restaurant, and fixing broken links.

        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Identifying User Needs: What do visitors of the website want to see?</h1>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          After finding out what the manager wanted out of the website, we went
          to the customers and conducted group interviews with the groups of
          Kinoyume customers to see which aspects of the website were pain points
          from a user perspective. Some major points the user hoped to see included:
          having a better looking site, making it easier to use, and being able
          to check restaurant reviews.
          Upon interviewing the customers, we grouped the interviewees into 3
          user personas based on shared value: convenience, budget, or service.

        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Putting it all together</h1>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          With all the information we received through interviewing our two major
          stakeholders, we now had to determine which aspects we would include
          in our prototype and define what was within the scope of our project
          and manageable within the time frame we had.

            To investigate potential ideas and features for
            our site, we did competitive analysis of 5 other small Japanese restaurant sites and 2
            chain restaurant websites to see how they demonstrated their color
            scheme, mood, site navigation, and other special features. Some of the
            key takeaways we drew from our analysis were to have very clean color
            palettes and styles throughout the site, splitting our long menu into
            different sections to allow for easier browsing, creating multiple pages
            for different sections of the site instead of having a singular landing page,
            and reducing the amount of text users will need to read. From these insights,
            we began thinking about site navigation and created moodboards that would encapsulate the feel of our
            website.

            <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
              With a clear vision of what we wanted to create for the website, we
              began with a wireframe that mostly outlined our site architecture,
              image placement, and home screen reorganization for both the mobile
              and desktop version. As a group, we also discussed potential issues and
              created fallback plans in case some of our features were not implementable.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
              After settling on our wireframe outline, we began adding in images,
              buttons, and actual text. My main role was working on the menu and its
              related pages, including the main menu page, the menu item customization page,
              and the payment page. In this first iteration, our menu had no images of
              specific dishes because the restaurant did not have the resources to be
              able to include an image with every single menu item. This was also
              where I included the idea of using tabular organization with icons to
              allow users to isolate and only see one food category at a time.

        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">Critiques + Higher Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          Upon completing our low fidelity prototype, we sought out critiques from
          our client, our peers, and our professor. Through this process, we
          received helpful feedback that allowed us to improve on our site.
          One major flaw we found was that we lacked any confirmation page,
          which made it unclear for the user whether their order had gone through
          or if their reservation was made. The site overall was still relatively
          plain so we added a cherry blossom background to begin synching the color scheme.
          I also experimented with a second version of the menu that split
          customization into a different page and enlarged the visual for the menu item.
          This would allow the menu page to appear less cluttered and allow the
          users to see the dish they are ordering which could help inform their decision.

        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">Upon completion of our previous iteration, we
          conducted one user test and provided them with scenarios to walk through our site.
          We received no complaints about the functionality and flow of our website,
          however they did have some qualms about our choice of background. They
          observed that the background was a little too distracting and clashed
          with the actual content of our website. The menu page was also a little
          too simple with the removal of all information except the name, image,
          and price of the dish. After receiving the feedback from this test, we created our final prototype.

        <h1 class="kinoyume-headings">What did I learn?</h1>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">As this was my first time working with a client,
          one challenge our group faced was managing client expectations and aligning
          that with the customersâ€™ needs and the widely-used practices in design.
          The feature that was most difficult to resolve was the inclusion of
          reviews on the website. Our client was adamant about not having reviews
          on the website or buying good reviews on Yelp because he felt it was
          biased and dishonest, whereas many of the users thought that the reviews
          were useful in helping them decide whether they wanted to eat there or
          what to order. We ended up deciding to follow the clientâ€™s request because,
          ultimately, the site was for him and the users could find other ways to
          find reviews themselves with external sites.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          Overall, this experience taught me the importance of iteration and how
          our designs can sometimes drastically change over the lifespan of our project.
          My role in the creation of the prototype was creating the menu pages.
          My main struggle was determining the right balance of information that
          would be present within one screen. I experimented with both having too
          much and too little information and through getting many iterations of
          feedback, I was able to identify the perfect mix of both.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="kinoyume-body">
          Ultimately, we were able to implement all of the features we planned for and created a site that I believe
          everyone was happy with.

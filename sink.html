        <h3 class="sink-body">There is always potential for improvement in the
          technological, social, and economic realm that is present on any
          college campus. But in the wake of a world-scale pandemic, the importance
          of hygiene has become more evident than ever. While measures such as
          hand sanitizing stations have been implemented to encourage frequent
          hand cleaning, not all germs can be killed by hand sanitizers. Visitors
          to UCSD need more effective and convenient ways in order to improve
          their hygiene on campus. </h3>
        <h3 class="sink-body">
          To address the problem space of hygiene on campus, our group identified
          many potential issues and developed a solution that would promote public hygiene.
          The final design of our product addresses these issues by providing
          a convenient and space-saving solution that separates drinking water
          from the sinks, thus promoting public hygiene.

        <h3 class="sink-body">
          We began our journey trying to find the problem space by brainstorming
          ways to improve circumstances for students on campus, such as study tools,
          consumer-seller transparency, or on-campus parking, etc. by using a
          survey to identify problems in task flow in many students’ daily routine.
          Through our 20 survey responses from students and faculty, we narrowed
          our topic down to collective hygiene in densely populated areas.
          We conducted targeted ethnographic research by observing students’
          interactions in Price Center and other dining halls on campus, observing
          handwashing, the student’s location from the bathrooms, and any handwashing
          signage in the bathrooms. Finally, with the data collected through
          this observation, we conducted further interviews of UCSD students
          in Price Center to interact and get better insight into the practices
          and reasoning behind their actions.

        <h3 class="sink-body">
          After gathering our research data, we utilized affinity diagrams to
          group our results into categories using color-coded sticky notes.
          These were sorted by pertinent hygiene factors and broke them down based
          on the level of hygiene they concerned, as well as the degree of hygiene conducted.
          Additionally, each group member created a user persona that encapsulated
          a stakeholder to allow us to empathize with the people affected by our designs.

        <h3 class="sink-body">
          Our project identified several key areas of focus. First, we found that
          densely populated areas on campus are the most unhygienic due to the
          sheer number of people passing by and the shortage of janitorial staff.
          Second, we recognize that people need to be prompted to increase their
          cleaning habits through authoritarian figures, posted notices, or
          enforced policies. Finally, we observed that individuals will avoid
          unclean areas and will only take it upon themselves to clean up the
          space if there are no clean locations available. From these 3 points,
          we decided to build upon the current systems of hygiene to make them more
          convenient and user-friendly. By doing so, we hope to maximize their
          potential and encourage wider adoption of these practices to create
          a cleaner and more hygienic environment for everyone on campus.

        <h1 class="sink-headings">What direction do we want to go in the field of hygiene?</h1>
        <h3 class="sink-body">
          During our project, we generated multiple ideas to tackle the hygiene
          issues identified in our research. After consolidating our ideas, we
          narrowed them down to three concepts: a trash-robot that can also
          clean the floor, a public sink located in a central location for
          easier access, and table sensors to detect when a table needs cleaning.
          To evaluate each concept, we generated storyboards to visualize the user
          experience and we discussed the pros and cons of each idea and eventually
          decided on the one that would be most feasible, socially accepted,
          and economically viable. Ultimately, this helped us develop a more
          focused and effective final product.

        <h1 class="sink-headings">What will our product ultimately look like?</h1>
        <h3 class="sink-body">
          During our project, we faced several challenges while designing features
          for our new sink. We began by having each group member sketch out
          potential designs for the sink. During our comparison stage, we debated
          whether to use pedals or sensors to activate the sink, whether to
          combine the sink with a water fountain, and how to arrange multiple
          sinks in one unit. We also had to consider the placement of objects
          such as the soap dispenser and paper towel dispenser. Finally, to
          prepare for user testing, we created 3 Figma prototypes where each
          prototype featured a different placement or type of arrangement for the sink.

      <div class="sink-column">
        <h2 class="sink-subheadings">Validation Testing</h2>
        <h1 class="sink-headings">Which features are the best to implement?</h1>
        <h3 class="sink-body">During our project, we conducted interviews and ABC
          testing (a variation of AB testing with 3 variables/designs) to gather
          feedback on our Figma prototypes. We walked participants through the
          three designs and asked for their feedback, focusing on which aspects
          they preferred and whether the design would address public hygiene needs.
          The results of the testing showed that participants preferred a
          separation of drinking water and the sink for sanitation purposes.
          We had initially considered combining multiple features to save space,
          but through this test, we realized this approach took us further away
          from our initial goal of promoting hygienic practices. Another important
          point was that pedals were preferred over sensors because the participants
          expressed how sensors are more prone to failure. Finally, the participants
          expressed concerns about line aggregation in models that combined
          a sink and a drinking fountain/water bottle refilling station. These
          insights helped us to refine our design and develop a more effective
          product that better addressed the needs of our stakeholders.

          Based on our research and testing, we developed a final design for
          our sink. The sink has a trapezoidal base with the large side facing
          a wall, and the two outer sides serving as the sinks. The middle section
          of the sink contains a water bottle refilling/drinking fountain station,
          effectively separating the two purposes of the product into two lines.
          This design addresses the need for sanitation by separating drinking
          water from the sinks, and it also provides a convenient and space-saving
          solution for users to more easily access the sink.

        <h1 class="sink-headings">What did I learn?</h1>
        <h3 class="sink-body">Overall, my experience on this project taught me the
          importance of consulting my stakeholders when creating my designs.
          Many design decisions are difficult to make on our own as a small
          group of designers, but are much easier when we draw on the multitude
          of perspectives and experiences our stakeholders bring. In addition,
          interviewing our stakeholders allows us to ultimately create a user-centric
          product that will truly solve their needs. Another point this project
          allowed me to experience was the importance of definitive decision making.
          When we were at our ideation stage, we had to make an executive decision
          in the further direction of our project. At the time it felt uncomfortable
          suddenly narrowing down our ideas and ignoring the rest and I had my
          doubts about whether we were choosing the right direction. However,
          in time, I was able to realize that the divergence and convergence of
          ideas is an inevitable part of the design process and I should embrace
          it full heartedly as part of the journey.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="sink-body">
          Ultimately, we were able to implement all of the features we planned for and created a site that I believe
          everyone was happy with.

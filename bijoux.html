        <div class="bijoux-body">Long distance relationships are hard enough as
          it is, but the limitations on the kinds of communication are frustrating
          for many. Calling, texting, and Facetime are all methods of long-distance
          communication, but they all lack the ability to capture the depth and
          sincerity in relationships. Anyone can send a text message or make a
          video call and thus lacks genuine connection and personal touch.
          <br><br>
          Our mission was to create a product that offers personalization and holds
          sentimental value for people who want to stay connected to their loved
          ones no matter the distance.

        <div class="bijoux-body">
          In order to be able to come up with a novel startup idea that could
          become profitable, we needed to identify a niche that our product would
          hope to fill. To begin, our group focused on fast fashion jewelry,
          gearing our research towards anyone who wears jewelry. We launched a
          survey that gathered data regarding habits and use of jewelry to help
          us identify any pain points or features that could be created.

            From our survey results, we focused on 6 ideas to storyboard, including
            incorporating safety, customizability, and new functionality to jewelry.
            We conducted user interviews to get an idea of which idea was the
            most appealing to our target audience, and the most popular was the
            digital locket that allowed users to communicate over long distances.

            In this stage of our project, we focused on our branding through
            launching a web probe and conducting AB testing to see which landing
            page would attract the most interest.
            <br>*insert web probe A and B<br>
            After finalizing our landing page, we created both Instagram ads and
            Google ads to find how interested people were in our product and the
            demographics of the people interested.

          <div class="bijoux-body">
            <h1 class="bijoux-headings">MVP</h1>

            For our minimum viable product (MVP), we created both what the app
            would look like and simulated what the actual digital locket would
            look like through an apple watch attached to a chain, allowing users
            to wear it as a necklace.
            <br><br>
            Some features we included were:
            <ul>
              <li>Allowing users to send and receive images to the locket</li>
              <li>Having a built in image gallery so user can customize their locket face easily</li>
              <li>Embedding biometric sensors to allow for mood sensing</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            Following this, we conducted 2 user tests to assess desirability of our
            proposed mode of connection for situations when people are apart from
            their loved ones. We also sought insights to enhance locket experience.
            <br>
            *results:
            <ul>
              <li>Considerations for determining which buttons will be physical
                and which will be on the locket face</li>
              <li>Function to schedule send images</li>

          <div class="flex">
            <div class="bijoux-body"> Our final step was considering the business
              aspect of our startup. We drafted a 6-month budget that accounted for
              the development of our physical product, all initial startup costs,
              monthly revenue, and monthly expenses to map out how we would make money.
              We also created a Kickstarter campaign to be able to allow us to have
              enough cash on hand to start our company.
              <br>
              *link kickstarter
              <br>

              We finalized our design for the app and locket with the feedback we
              received from our user tests and refined our product to match our style guide.
              <br>
              
              <br>
              In the final presentation of our project, we competed against 11 other
              teams and won the catalyst funding for our idea.
